You have been wandering through the forest for several hours, it is cold and you are frigid. You happen upon a mansion here in the darkness, seeing your salvation you head in, however, things are not quite as they seem. Fight through to purge the darkness from the Heart of Hateforge manor and uncover its secrets. 

Inspired by lovecraftian elements, I wanted this map to reflect the classic haunted mansion theme, as a result the walls are covered in portraits, has several hidden areas, and multiple secrets that are locked away and out of sight. The process for making this map was a fun one being perfectly honest. I started with the process of developing a theme and the Alice WAD by American McGee was the perfect source of inspiration. The portraits made me want to develop it into a mansion full of hidden passages. While it was ambitious for my first map, I felt that I met the challenge admirably. I plan on developing more features on this map in the future. Such as a secret in every room and maybe expanding the mansion to have an outside area at some point. The MAP file and BSP are both available for download in the Repo.
